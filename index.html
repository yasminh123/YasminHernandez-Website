        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Yasmin Hernandez. I was born in Loma Linda, California and have lived in Southern California ever since. I graduated from Eisenhower High School seventh in my class with a 4.3 GPA. While in high school I played Varsity Girls Tennis for two years and was the Boys Tennis manager for three years. I was in the Girlsâ€™ Sobobans Honor Society and the Future Business Leaders of America club. I also took an Internship class in which we honed skills such as; how to create portfolios, succeed at job interviews, apply for college, etc. While in my four years of high school I studied French and graduated with a seal of biliteracy on my diploma. During my time in high school, I worked as a French tutor on Saturdays at my schoolâ€™s Step-Up program. <br><br>

        I initially attended UC Irvine with a Criminology/Law and Society major after graduation, but then transferred to UC Riverside after my second year. While at Irvine, I was a part of the Campuswide Honors Program before changing my major and my university. I am currently pursuing a BA in Political Science and am set to graduate in June 2020. I plan to attend law school after graduation and become an immigration lawyer. I am considering whether to return to Irvine and attend UCIâ€™s School of Law or apply elsewhere and attend a brand new school.<br><br>

        I have worked in the Accounts Payable department of Hub Construction Specialties. While there I had to upload vendor files to the system and set up payments to vendors for two days out of the month. On the 10th and 25th of every month checks had to be sent out and expense reports created to manage the payment system. I now work in the Receiving department at the Toms Distribution Center as a receiving clerk. My job consists of creating folders for incoming containers and entering dimensions for products that are set to arrive. On a shared google doc, I make changes to the schedule depending on when containers are going to arrive and what is expected to come in each container. When they arrive, I must make movements so that the containers can be backed into the dock, they are then unloaded and received and put away. From working at these two places I have learned a lot on how to manage my time wisely as well as how to balance the workload. I have had experience with the Anzio, NolaPro, and SCALE systems at these jobs and have become skilled through the repetitive use of Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel.
